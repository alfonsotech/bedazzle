A Chrome extension which adds a faux rich text editor for Twitter.  Faux, because it actually adds unicode transforming functions to your Tweet editor on twitter.com.

## Credit

This extension relies heavily code borrowed from [unicate](https://github.com/afiler/unicate/) ([demo here](http://mar.cx/unicate/)), created by Andrew Filer ([@afiler](https://github.com/afiler)).
